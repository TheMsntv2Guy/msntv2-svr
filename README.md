# MSN TV 2 Server
This is a attempt to recreate MSN TV 2 servers. \
I just bought a MSN TV 2 box, development will begin when it shows up. ( it was 102$ with taxes and shipping :[, I did buy a new one, Unboxing video will be posted on my Youtube )

# What does this do?
It's going to ask like a authentication server for MSN TV 2 boxes so the boxes can be probably used again. \
and I will probably will add some more functionally to this server whenever I can.
