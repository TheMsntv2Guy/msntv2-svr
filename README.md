# MSNTV2-SVR
This is a attempt to recreate MSN TV 2 servers. \
Currently I don't own a MSN TV 2 box, so development will be slow. \

# What does this do?
It's going to ask like a authentication server for MSN TV 2 boxes so the boxes can be probably used again. \
and I will probably will add some more functionally to this server whenever I can.

# How to use the server script. 
Note: The server isn't complete yet. \
First download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) The latest version is recommended, If you already have Python installed skip this step\
Then install python and open a terminal, run `cmd` if on windows, or use any terminal on linux.\
Then run `python -m pip install Flask` or `python3 -m pip install Flask`\
Now download the serv.py file. \
Then run it with `python serv.py` or `python3 serv.py`
